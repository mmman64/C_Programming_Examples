# C Programming Examples

Having taken a certain well-known online intro to CS course* I was required to solve some problems in C.

Here are my solutions that I will update over time as I learn more about C and programming in general.

I'm using the [Microsoft C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) for Visual Studio Code and the [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension to run these programs locally on OSX.

## Pset1

### Specs:

1. *half_pyramid.c*
   + Get user input between a specified range (0 - 23)
   + Print out a half pyramid (as seen in Super Mario) consisting of spaces and hashes

1. *money.c*
   + Get user input in dollars
   + Output the minimum number of coins that can be given in change (from 25, 10, 5, 1 cent coins)



### Learning goals:

* [x] Getting user input
* [x] Converting a string to an int
* [x] Nested loops
* [x] Printing output
* [x] Arithmetic operations
* [x] Working with ints and floats

*Course unnamed in order to respect wishes not to litter the internet with easily searchable solutions... but here's a sneaky hint:
